Write software emulates the real world - Object oriented programming (OOP)

1. Real world actors -> Objects in the RAM (data points in the RAM)
    'mehul chopra' -> RAM (5004) -> object
    34 -> RAM (5007) -> object
    Student -> object
    Student -> object
    Professor -> object
    Professor -> object

    class -> 1 to n objects
    class gives a data type to an object -> name of the class -> data type of the object

2. Real world actor characteristics -> Attributes of the object in the RAM

3. Real world actor actions -> Methods called on the object
